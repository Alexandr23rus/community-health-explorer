# Community Health Explorer

The Community Health Explorer is a joint project between the City of Philadelphia's [Department of Public Health](http://www.phila.gov/health/) and [Office of Innovation and Technology](http://www.phila.gov/it). The Explorer is intended to provide easy-to-use, responsive and accessible visualization tools for viewing the vast amount of data collected annually for the Community Health Assessment. 

## About the Community Health Assessment (CHA)

The CHA includes indicators reflecting health behaviors, health conditions, health care factors, and social and environmental determinants of health.
